        <h2>With your donations we provide</h2>
        <li>
            <h4>Shelter</h4>
            <p>We provide shelter for many of 
                our cats and dogs. In addition 
                to a roof over their heads, we 
                pay for heat, food, water, and 
                electricity, and general 
                maintenance.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Vetting</h4>
            <p>We provide vet care to our Cats
                and dogs. We take care of
                general health assessments
                medications, vaccinations,
                spay/neuter procedures, and
                other surgeries.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4> Facilities</h4>
            <p>
                We currently utilize a facility in
                a dilapidated state, which has
                necessitated significant
                investments to make it usable
                again. We are still restoring the
                building to its full potential.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Transport</h4>
            <p>Each year, we transport over 600
                dogs and 350 cats from kill
                shelters and emergency
                distressing situations to hospitals
                or our shelter, providing them
                with a second chance at life.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Fosters</h4>
            <p>We're lucky to have a group of
                individuals who generously
                foster our cats and dogs in
                their homes. We cover all their
                veterinary needs and provide
                necessary food supplies.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Food</h4>
            <p>Each year, we nourish our Cats
                and dogs with over 2,200 cans
                of wet food and 1,600 pounds
                of dry food to ensure their well-
                being and keep them content 
                and thriving.
